This is a collection of utilities that I have written for automating some of my tasks involving audio and image files. There is also a simple backup utitily. I have not written any documentation or man pages, but some of the utilitiles display a usage instruction if invoked with --help. In the unlikely event that somebody would want to redistribute any of the files, please keep in mind that the license is GPL version 2.
