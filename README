This is a collection of utilities that I have written for automating some of my tasks involving audio and image files. There is also a simple backup utitily. I have not written any documentation or man pages, but some of the utilitiles display a usage instruction if invoked with --help. In the unlikely event that somebody would want to redistribute any of the files, please keep in mind that the license is GPL version 2.

These utilities have been developed and tested exclusively on Linux. In theory, they could be usable on any UNIX-like system, provided that all required packages are installed.

Brief overview of the utilities
-------------------------
batch-convert-imgs.rb: converts and resizes image files between different formats. It is a front-end to the GraphicsMagick tools. It has powerful batch options that allow you to recursively process a whole directory tree.

qt/BatchConvertImages: a qt-based GUI for batch-convert-imgs.rb.

copy-exif.rb: copies exif data from source to derived image. Can find the source deep down in a directory as long as there is a name resemblance between source and derived image.

batch-oggencode.rb: converts FLAC files to OGG (or optionally MP3). Can process a whole directory tree.

batch-tag-flac.rb: tags FLAC files automatically based on the files' names and directory names. Probably not very useful for anyone except me.

adjust-wav-freq.rb: rewrites the recording frequency of a WAVE file without altering the file in any other way.
adjust-flac-freq.rb: rewrites the recording frequency of a FLAC file without altering the file in any other way.
batch-adjust-flac-freq.rb: applies the above utility to a batch of files.

relocate.rb: processes a directory tree and converts between relative and absolute symbolic links, and vice versa.

rsbackup.rb: my backup program based on rsync. The interface language is Swedish (sorry!).
